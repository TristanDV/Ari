I was once of the belief that i could never love a person that i had never met but you made me relize the truth is you do not have to meet someone to fall in love with them.<br/><br/> As someone who has many hobbies, ranging from tennis to writing poems and stories to making origami. In that time i have also learnt to code and decided to create this project specially for you, Arianna(hope that is spelt right XD)<br/><br/><br/> Since it was a gift to you i wanted to go above and beyond, I hope you like it.
